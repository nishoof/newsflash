Google Store now sells a third-party Pixel Watch band

After three generations of the Pixel Watch, the Google Store is selling the first watch band from a third-party manufacturer.

That honor unsurprisingly goes to the “Spigen Rugged Band for Google Pixel Watch 3,” with the Bellroy’s offering not yet on the Google Store. Made of thermoplastic polyurethane, this black band has “carbon fiber accents and a matte finish.”

This Spigen band is available in 41 and 45mm, with the former size presumably also working with the Pixel Watch and Pixel Watch 2. The strap pairs well with the Spigen Rugged Armor Case for the Pixel Watch to complete the G-Shock aesthetic. It’s definitely a sharp contrast to Google’s more minimal watch bands.

The Spigen Rugged Band costs $34.99 at the US Google Store and is also available at other retailers, like Amazon. 

Meanwhile, the Google Store today also listed the Spigen Silicone Fit Case for Google TV Streamer. This accessory is meant to “Keep your Google TV Streamer safe and sound” with a rubber perimeter that keeps the pill-shaped face open. (U: Heat might be a better explanation for that design. Thanks Omega192)

The underside has an opening, as well as adhesive tape. Of note is the included lanyard that can be used to hang the device to the back of your television or bracket/mount. This costs $39.99 and is also available in Hazel.
