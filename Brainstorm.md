- Idea: basically just summarizing the news daily

summarize daily headlines
- multiple different sources
- makes it less biased

personalize 
- based on what you want to know about
	- politics, entertainment (sports), stocks, tech
	- local news based on your location??
- different formats?
	- paragraph, bullet point

can send daily summaries (email, discord, however you want)

option to make it into a youtube short

## App Plan
1) get user's preferences
2) webscraper to get headlines
3) feed into gpt to summarize
4) display to the frontend
5) notify (email, discord message, notification, whatever)
6) *or yt short thing if we have time*
